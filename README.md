# CookedUp

Unity Game inspired by Overcooked and PlateUp! with Bots AI using ASP

## About

This game builds upon this fantastic [free youtube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg) by [Code Monkey](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeMonkeyUnity)

It is my **thesis project** for my bachelor's degree, which focuses on creating a **Bot AI** using **[Answer Set Programming](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Answer_set_programming)** (ASP) to play this game.

More specifically, I'm using the [ThinkEngine](https://github.com/DeMaCS-UNICAL/ThinkEngine) Framework to facilitate the communication between Unity and the ASP solvers it supports ([DLV](https://dlv.demacs.unical.it/home) and [clingo](https://github.com/potassco/clingo))
